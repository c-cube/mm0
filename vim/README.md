# Vim syntax

This directory contains some basic vim files for syntax coloring.

## Install

Copy the subdirectories into `$HOME/.vim/`
(e.g. with `cp -r vim/* ~/.vim/`).

With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), the following stanza
should work (in `.vimrc`):

```
Plug 'digama0/mm0', { 'rtp': 'vim' }
```
